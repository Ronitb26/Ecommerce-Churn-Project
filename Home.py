# <p style='text-align: center;'>🔍 Predictive Churn Modeling with Business Strategies</p>

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to tackle one of the most critical challenges in the e-commerce domain — **customer churn**.
By leveraging machine learning models and data-driven insights, this app helps businesses identify customers 
likely to churn and provides actionable retention strategies to reduce potential revenue loss.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Churn Data Analysis Module
- Provides in-depth analysis of churn across the entire dataset.
- Visualizes trends, distributions, and correlations to help businesses understand key churn drivers.

### 2. Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy Module
- Predicts the **churn probability** of an individual customer.
- Generates **personalized retention recommendations** based on customer-specific attributes such as Tenure, 
  Satisfaction Score, Order Patterns, and more.
- Allows users to explore **feature-level impact** on churn probability and see **how each feature shifts the 
  predicted probability from its base value**.

### 3. Feature Impact & Explainability Module
- Uses **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to explain the impact of features on the model’s churn prediction.
- Helps stakeholders interpret why certain customers are at a higher risk of churn.
